        <p>After a relaxing mid-semester break, the cohort launched straight into assignment two. This was all about refining the initial idea to produce a design concept which was ready for production. I took the time to experiment with different mediums and to decide which would most effectively convey my desired animation aesthetic. I began by exploring the idea of expressing my concepts traditionally through watercolour paintings - which is generally my preferred medium.</p>
        
          <hr>
        <p>However, there were some limitations using them to express concepts for animation. Firstly, technically the concepts weren't "finished" or "at their final stages" as they would most likely be digitalised for animation. Secondly, I found myself falling into the rut of not wanting to experiment and push my concepts even further creatively as there is no undo button with traditional mediums. <span>With that being said, I went out and got myself a tablet.</span></p>

<p><span>WHY 2.5D ANIMATION WAS CHOSEN: </span>As the name suggests, 2.5D combines elements of both 2D and 3D animation. They tend to still have a light source and some shadows unlike 2D, however characters and environments cannot easily be rotated like they can in 3D. It allows the animator to create fake depths through multi-layer compositing, whereas 3D is everything modelled together.</p>
          
          <hr>

<p>Both Gorillaz and Batman utilise 2.5D animation while Coraline has a hyper 3D appearance due to use of stop motion. Due to the concepts and themes within my animation, I steered clear from 3D approaches due to heavy use within kid’s movies and fairytales, while I still wished for a level of realism so the audience can connect with the characters. This combination was perfect. Investigating into the animation styles of some other music videos and movies provided clear guidance as to what elements need to be included in my own concept.

        <p><span>The Jail</span> was the first setting I explored initially from Assessment One. The Batman film-noir / dark-deco style really influenced me in determining the jail's overall appearence. The somewhat dooming and foreboading feeling you get was very suitable and relevent therefore the style works very well here.</p>
              <hr>
        
          <p><span>The Newsroom</span> shortly followed. Although the sketches for this setting were very promising, once digitalised, I decided the bright aesthetic did not fit the animation's overall tone. With this said, I will alter the final script so the anchor is already on the scene to avoid showing the newsroom.</p>

        <p>For the concept art, I wanted to somehow portray the lengths that some people go for love. Although simple, I feel it clearly conveys the themes and plot structure.</p>
              <hr>
        
          <p>The inclusion of the couple drawing in the sky was inspired from similar overlaying techniques in romance novels. However, I really enjoy the organic and roughness of the drawing as opposed to being done digitally as the shading makes the couple appear magical and godlike. This result would not be achievable digitally.</p>
